## Overview

The JSSDK provides access to Akool Streaming Avatar services, enabling programmatic control of avatar interactions. You can connect and manage avatars in live sessions using WebSockets for seamless communication. This allows you to send text commands to avatars, enabling real-time speech with customizable voices. The JSSDK simplifies the creation, management, and termination of avatar sessions programmatically.

- Vanilla javascript and light weight dependency files
- Integrating interactive avatar just by one line js code
- Handling avatar interactions and responses
- Managing audio streams

The integration uses Agora's Real-Time Communication (RTC) SDK for reliable, low-latency streaming and our avatar service for generating responsive avatar behaviors.
